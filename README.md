### Hello, my name is Kez.
I have a B.A. in Computer Science and Software Engineering from UW Bothell with an emphasis on Math. Here are a few things about me:
-  I’m currently working on a SQLite database for concert ticket management and some AI experiments
-  I’m currently learning SQLite with VSCode, bash, and Python; reinforcement learning algorithms in python; mathimatical proofs in LaTeX
-  How to reach me: [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/keziahmay/)
-  Pronouns: she/her/hers
-  Fun fact: I ride motorcycles, pick up heavy things, and love to meet people
